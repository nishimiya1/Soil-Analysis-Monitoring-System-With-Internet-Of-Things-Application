# This study is designed to help farmers improve their monitoring and management of agricultural fields. It uses sensors placed in the soil to measure important parameters like soil moisture, soil temperature, environmental temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels. The system also includes an irrigation system that supplies water to the plants based on the monitored soil moisture levels. Farmers can access the collected data and predictions through a mobile application, allowing them to remotely monitor and manage their fields. This technology empowers farmers to make informed decisions and optimize their farming practices.
